# computorv1

`computorv1` is a command-line program written in C that solves polynomial equations of degree 2 or less. The program takes an equation in the form of a string as input and outputs the solutions of the equation.

### Features

- Solves polynomial equations of degree 2 or less
- Supports real and complex solutions
- Handles input errors and provides helpful error messages
- Allows users to enter equations using shorthand notation

### Usage

The program takes a polynomial equation as input and solves for its roots. The equation should be provided as a string argument enclosed in double quotes.

Here's an example of how to run the program:

```
./computorv1 "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"
```
